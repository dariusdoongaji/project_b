	Hey there stragner! <br> <br>
	
	Welcome to this very strange place. Here are some tips: <br> <br>

	Use WASD to move around and IJKL to look around. W also makes the pig move forward and S backwards <br> 
	with the up and down arrow keys you can control the speed of the cowboys arms...and also other things scattered around. <br>

	The donut in the middle can draged around with your mouse. <br> <br>

	Have fun!
